BEAM BLOCKAGE MODULE
  BEAMB

BEAMB is completly dependent on a working RAVE installation so refer
to RAVEs installation instructions before installing BEAMB.

When you have successfully installed RAVE, you should only need to perform
the traditional configure, make, make install.

%> ./configure --prefix=/opt/n2/beamb --with-rave=/opt/n2/rave
%> make
%> make test
%> make install

Since beamb keeps a cache with the beam blockage classification, you might want
to specify an alternative location of the cache-files. The default location is
<prefix>/var/cache/beamb (/opt/baltrad/beamb/var/cache/beamb). 
But can be changed by specifying the --localstatedir=<cachedir>. Be aware that
cache/beamb is always appended to the cache path which means that
the following configure call:

%> ./configure ... --localstatedir=/var

would create a directory called /var/cache/beamb during installation.
